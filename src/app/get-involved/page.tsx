        <p className="mb-4">
          FOAF Foundation is seeking aligned partners and early-stage funders who share our belief
          that local resilience, peer-to-peer infrastructure, and mutual credit systems are essential
          for the next generation of economic coordination. We are not just launching an appâ€”we are
          building the protocol layer for cooperation itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are especially interested in connecting with funders and partners at the intersection of
          regenerative agriculture, decentralized infrastructure, food justice, and crypto-for-good.
          Our goal is to prove this system works through a focused launch of GrowOperative, and evolve
          it into a robust, DAO-governed mutual credit network.
